# Testing
As the webpage was being built Chrome developer tools were used to ensure that the code was working smoothly. Each section was then tested again every time a new feature was added.

Pre-deployment I checked that the webpage met all the user needs previously stated.

The webpage was tested on multiple viewports each time a section was added or updated to make sure everything was working correctly.
Post-deployment the webpage was tested across a number of devices to ensure it remained responsive. Some of the devices that were tested: Iphone 5, Iphone 11, Samsung A5, Samsung S8, Ipad pro and a Toshiba laptop.

Post-deployment the webpage was opened and tested on three different search engines

**Bugs**


* [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
>W3C Markup Validator was used to check the HTML code. Any bugs that came up were due to outdated styles in the iframe element. These were simply removed and then resolved by updating the CSS for the iframe element.

* Viewport Testing
> The webpage was opened on a number of different screen sizes to ensure it worked on all viewports.
